# Node.js Tutorial

This repo inlcudes some of the notes, code snippets of the Node.js, Express and EJS included in the backend part of the **Full Stack Development Course** by **Angela Yu** form **Udemy**. 

The repo also contains a Node.js project; a blogging app in which the users can add new blogs, modify and delete existing ones. It's built with the help of **Express**, **EJS** and **body-parser**.
