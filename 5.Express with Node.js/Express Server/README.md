# Express Server

This is a basic Express.js web server setup. Let's go through it line by line:

- `import express from "express";` imports the Express.js framework. This line uses ES modules syntax rather than the older require() syntax.

- `const app = express();` creates a new Express application instance. This app object is where we'll define our routes and middleware.

- `const port = 3000;` defines which port number the server will listen on. Port 3000 is commonly used for development.

`The app.get("/", ...)` line creates a route handler for GET requests to the root path `("/")`. When someone visits the homepage:

- `res.send("Hello World!")` sends the text response back to the client
-  `console.log(req.rawHeaders)` prints the raw HTTP headers from the request to the server console
- Finally, `app.listen(port, ...)` starts the server:

The server begins listening for incoming connections on port 3000

When the server starts successfully, it logs a message to the console

This is a minimal Express server - it only handles GET requests to the homepage and returns "Hello World!". 

To run this in VS Code, you would:
- Open the integrated terminal
- Run node index.js
- Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
